generated from imported PMI
Naming conventions are used to organize the Quality Characteristics and Characteristic Groups that are
generated when you import product and manufacturing information (PMI) from a part. The naming
pattern in the naming convention is based on the attributes of the Quality Characteristics. These Quality
Characteristics are generated and added to a Characteristic Group, whose Characteristic Type and name
you define in the naming convention in the Quality Master Data library. The name of the Characteristic
Group is a combination of the attributes and the delimiter defined in the naming convention.
By default, the following naming conventions are available:

Create a naming rule to process the imported PMI,"Naming rules process the product and manufacturing information (PMI) from a part’s 3D/2D data to
create Quality Characteristics based on naming conventions. In the naming rule, you can create multiple
conditions based on the attributes of PMI. You must also define a default naming convention for creating
Quality Characteristics. The default naming convention is used when any of the naming rule conditions
are not met. By default, you can use the available attributes of PMIs from BCT Inspector to create
conditions in the naming rule. If required, you can configure Control Plan to display more BCT Inspector
attributes through Business Modeler Integrated Development Environment (BMIDE).
By default, an active naming rule is available after installing Control Plan. This naming rule has a default
naming convention for creating Variable Quality Characteristics, and no conditions are defined for the
rule.

What are Quality Characteristics?,"Quality Characteristics are the attributes of a Part or Process that must be monitored during
manufacturing to deliver a high-quality product. You can create the following types of Quality
Characteristics:
• Variable: Defines the specific values to be measured, including the nominal values, its tolerance
values, and the unit of measure.
• Attributive: Defines which attributes are acceptable in the OK Condition field and the ones that are
unacceptable in the Not OK Condition field.
• Visual: Specifies the images of the defects that can occur or standard specification images."
Create and add the Quality Characteristics to a Characteristic Group,"1. On the HOME page, click the QUALITY MASTER DATA tile.
2. In the Quality Master Data location, click the Characteristics Library page.
3. In the left pane, select the Characteristic Group where you want to add Quality Characteristics.
4. Choose More commands > New > Add Characteristic .
5. To create a Variable Quality Characteristic, do the following:
Create and add the Quality Characteristics to a Characteristic Group
If you have selected a Variable Characteristic Group, specify the following information for the
Quality Characteristic:
Field Description
Naming Convention Select the naming convention of the Quality
Characteristic.
Description Enter a description for the Quality Characteristic.
Context Select whether the Quality Characteristic is for a product
or a process.
Dimension Type Select the type of dimension being measured by the
Quality Characteristic. You can also enter a custom
dimension, such as Density, by typing the custom
dimension, and pressing Enter.
Unit Of Measure Select the unit of measurement to be used for the
Quality Characteristic.
Nominal Value Enter a nominal value of the Quality Characteristic.
Upper Tolerance Enter an upper tolerance of the Quality Characteristic.
Lower Tolerance Enter a lower tolerance of the Quality Characteristic.

Tolerance Type Absolute
Upper Tolerance 52
Lower Tolerance 48
Now, if you update Tolerance Type to Relative, the
following values are displayed:"
