5,"1. About Control Plan in Teamcenter
Teamcenter Control Plan is a documented description of the systems used in minimizing process and
product variation. It contains all critical and significant quality inspection characteristics (process and
product related) that are required in the production process. The goal of a Control Plan is to trim down
the inefficiencies in a process by identifying their source and monitoring them. This decreases product
development time and reduces overall cycle times and associated costs. When you use a Control Plan to
focus on the critical aspects of a process, you can improve the efficiency and increase profitability.
A Control Plan:
• Describes the actions required at each phase of the process to assure that all process outputs are
controlled.
• Focuses on the product characteristics that are most important to the customer and the business.
• Reduces scrap, eliminates costly rework, and prevents defective products from reaching customers.
• Improves manufacturing efficiency and drives positive bottom-line returns.
• Sustains product and process improvements over a long period of time by assuring that the process
will not revert to the previous state.
Example:
Consider a scenario where you are manufacturing a front plate casing. You want to ensure that the
quality is maintained while various operations are performed to create the front plate casing. To
ensure the quality, you create a Control Plan that defines which operations are being performed.
Additionally, you also define what measurements must be inspected after each operation is
performed.
To manufacture a front plate casing, you need to perform the Punching, Alignment of the
punching holes, and Deburring operations. When a quality engineer inspects the front plate
casing after the Punching operation is performed, they must ensure that the diameter of the
punched holes is 20 mm. For the Alignment of the punching holes operation, the quality
engineer must ensure that the punched holes are correctly aligned. Additionally, after the
Deburring operation is done, the quality engineer must perform a surface check to ensure that
the surface does not have any defects.
Using Teamcenter Control Plan, you can do this by creating a Control Plan for the front plate
casing. In Teamcenter, add the Punching, Alignment of the punching holes, and Deburring
operations to be tracked. For each operation, add an Inspection Definition that defines the
characteristics that must be measured while inspecting the part on the shop floor.
Finally, when a quality engineer inspects the front plate casing assembly on the shop floor,
the quality engineer checks that the Punching, Alignment of the punching holes, and

13,"4. Setting up naming conventions and rules
Create a naming convention to organize the Quality Characteristics
generated from imported PMI
Naming conventions are used to organize the Quality Characteristics and Characteristic Groups that are
generated when you import product and manufacturing information (PMI) from a part. The naming
pattern in the naming convention is based on the attributes of the Quality Characteristics. These Quality
Characteristics are generated and added to a Characteristic Group, whose Characteristic Type and name
you define in the naming convention in the Quality Master Data library. The name of the Characteristic
Group is a combination of the attributes and the delimiter defined in the naming convention.
By default, the following naming conventions are available:

Create a naming rule to process the imported PMI
Naming rules process the product and manufacturing information (PMI) from a part’s 3D/2D data to
create Quality Characteristics based on naming conventions. In the naming rule, you can create multiple
conditions based on the attributes of PMI. You must also define a default naming convention for creating
Quality Characteristics. The default naming convention is used when any of the naming rule conditions
are not met. By default, you can use the available attributes of PMIs from BCT Inspector to create
conditions in the naming rule. If required, you can configure Control Plan to display more BCT Inspector
attributes through Business Modeler Integrated Development Environment (BMIDE).
By default, an active naming rule is available after installing Control Plan. This naming rule has a default
naming convention for creating Variable Quality Characteristics, and no conditions are defined for the
rule.

Overview of the Characteristic Library
The Characteristic Library is a collection of all existing Characteristic Groups and their Quality
Characteristics that you create in the Quality Master Data library. You can view, search, and filter the
Characteristic Groups to work on the required group. In the group, you can add or modify the required
Quality Characteristics.
The Characteristic Library provides the following benefits:
• Common quality standard within a company that can be shared by different products and processes
• Detection of unknown quality dependencies because the Characteristics are shared between different
products and processes
• Easy way to structure the data
• Enhancement of the quality data by using versioning. Users can see what has changed and update to
the latest version.
What are Quality Characteristics?
Quality Characteristics are the attributes of a Part or Process that must be monitored during
manufacturing to deliver a high-quality product. You can create the following types of Quality
Characteristics:
• Variable: Defines the specific values to be measured, including the nominal values, its tolerance
values, and the unit of measure.
• Attributive: Defines which attributes are acceptable in the OK Condition field and the ones that are
unacceptable in the Not OK Condition field.
• Visual: Specifies the images of the defects that can occur or standard specification images.
Create a Characteristic Group
In a Characteristic Group, you group multiple characteristics that define the different measurements that
must be executed on the shop floor. The quality department uses Characteristic Groups to structure their
different quality measurement standards globally. You can create the following types of Characteristic
Groups:
• Variable: Used to group Variable Quality Characteristics.

Add a control method
Control method statistics and charts are used to measure and control the quality of your manufacturing
processes. A control method defines how control method statistics and charts can be used on the shop
floor for a specific Control Plan, operation, or Inspection Definition. When you add a control method, you
can specify the type of Quality Characteristic, industry rules, type of chart, and the size of the subgroup.

To import product and manufacturing information (PMI) from parts with associated JT data, you must
convert this data to the IPXML format. When you submit the part to the Ballooning of 2D/3D Drawings
or Models workflow, the associated JT data is converted to the IPXML format. You can then import the
PMI from this part into the Inspection Definitions of a Control Plan or its operations. You can also directly
attach these types of JT and IPXML files to the part and import the PMI:
• 3D data (JT) with the Direct Model type and a relation of Rendering
• IPXML dataset with the PMI XML type and a relation of PMI XMLRelation
When you attach a JT or IPXML file to the item, ensure that you select the Relation specified in the
